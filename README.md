Image Classifier Project
For the 'AI Programming with Python' shortcourse I took through RMIT Online (powered by Udacity) I built and trained a deep neural network to develop an image classifier for different kinds of flowers.The second portion of the project includes the two files “predict.py” and “train.py” which allow the user to enter hyperparameters and pre-trained networks types into the command line to train and predict a dataset of images. Both parts print training loss, validation loss, and testing accuracy.
